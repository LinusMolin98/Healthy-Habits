# The 5 elements of UX design and how i worked with it to create my website

- Im very into fitness and motivational content, its something i indulge in everyday and my social media algorithms are filled with it. When i made the strategy for the website it was important for me to think what i as a user would appreciate seeing in a motivational website.
Wich led me to thinking that the content should be modern, easy to access, minimalistic and appealing. For a user of this content, the simplicitiy plays a big part, the quotes should lead you on and make you want more content. The father paving the way for his son symbolizes the will to improve for coming generations, wich then leads you as a user to a feeling of fullfillment. That hopefully makes you sign up for more inspirational content through Healthy Habits. I wanted bright colors and a clean look, wich would bare the same feeling as a gym. Hopefully thats the message i got through. 

- The structure of the site felt like one of the more important parts from a user point of view. As i wrote above, the appeal of the website is important when captivating someone through motivational content. Thats why i though a well structured but simple website with punching content would fit for a user. The structure is simple, easy to follow and does not over complicate anything. Wich also felt important in making the content interesting. 

- When creating the wireframe (skeleton) i had a clear picture in mind wich i also had planned out with my mentor, wich made it easy for me to take the first steps in creating a well design and thought through skeleton. The website is minimalistic, wich is the preference used, and the skeleton followed the line of the love running project, but on a simpler scale without as much content and ofcourse in my own way. Header - Main content - Footer made the skeleton, after that bright and uplifting colors where used to style it, wich also shined through in the content when that was added. Creating a sophisticated wireframe before the project started was essential for its developement going smooth. 

- The content and surface plane feels explained in the above text. The minimalistic feeling and captivating content was the important part, not making it to hard for me as a beginner developer but still creating content that would make sense for a user and be soothing to indulge in. Thought through with the quotes from famous athletes to spark a feeling inside the user, to then using the father and his son on the hockeu rink to create a sense of fullfillment, to then making it make sense for the user to sign up and get more inspirational content. The trick is to not give much, but still give enough for it to be interesting. That was something i learned while studying my bachelours degree in business. 

## Bug fixing 

- While bug fixing i ran my code through w3c occasionally during the process to se if i wrote anything wrong, i made it common practice to change and update the code throughout the process. I had a private file where i tried and tested code out before putting into my public codeanywhere IDE to see how it would respond. If it worked well and the changes where good, i cleaned the code of this public file up and copied the code to save myself time and energy, while making the public file run well. 

- I have also linked websites wich helped me fixing bugs and errors where i couldnt understand what was wrong, such as in the CSS, wich gave me the most headache. I indulged in alot of content wich helped alot in understanding how the css could make my content fit in the website, it would have been near impossible without it.
