## Features Left to Implement

- **Additional Feature Idea:** I would like to increase the page content, get more pictures into the tips page and tidy up the get in contact page. Healthy Habits would get a positive lift if the sign_up page had a picture.

## Testing

### Browser and Screen Size Testing
The website has been tested on various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and screen sizes to ensure a consistent and responsive user experience. The site performed well across different devices thanks to the media queries incorporated in the CSS file.
The links in the navbar works fine, it could be optimized through using a hamburger icon. Social media links works without errors.

### Validator Testing
