## Content 
Favicon structure and content is inspired from the love running project and follows a similar syntax. 

- Pictures have been taken from unsplash.com - (link here) <https://unsplash.com/s/photos/fitness>
- Footer content inspired and based on the love running project, with the social media links. But also by myself with inspiration from what i learned in the modules.
- Font awesome kit used (link) <https://kit.fontawesome.com/3b20d96fa9.js,> (Social media icons, same as the love running project) <https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css> (Text-font)
- I got information about using multiple stylesheets from Stack-overflow while scouting for information. (Link here) <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4284499/use-multiple-css-stylesheets-in-the-same-html-page>
- Got information about how to make a background img follow the page size through https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/circular-images-css/ 
- Introduced a video container in the tips.html, made it interactive with the help of css instead of Java, this was quite tricky but with the help from https://reintech.io/blog/creating-responsive-video-player-with-css i made it work. 
- They had the correct code wich i could use to make the video worked, so i used it and linked my own video file into it. 

## Added a new css styleheet for the navbar
- Reason for this is to make it as clean as possible, and not having any file overrun with information. 
- revised 
- The stylesheet was deleted, because it hindered the navbar from being functional. It did not communicate well with the project, i took the decision to only work with one style.css file.
- Changed idea due to problems with the burger icon, the project will have an interactive nav menu without the burger icon due to the lack of time.

## Added Hero Image 

- Hero image added, link here https://unsplash.com/photos/topless-man-in-black-shorts-sitting-on-black-and-silver-barbell-9dzWZQWZMdE
- Styled with inline css at first for simplicity, this move was inspired after watching the module, since i wanted this to target the hero content specifically without removing any css from style.css regarding the heading content.
- This might change during the build and be moved over to the style.css file.
- Tried adding the Hero image CSS to style.css file instead of inline css, this did not work as i wanted, so i decided to stick with inline css for this part. I did not want to over complicate anything.

## Style
-Font family used: Josefin Sans link here <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans>
- Navbar is now working, its responsive and looks clean. Code is still messy but that will be cleaned in a later stage. 
- Inspiration was taken from the css and html module from codeinstitute, aswell as the love running project where the burger icon was used. 
- Wen making the pictures fit i also used information from - <https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=How+to+make+content+pictures+work+well+with+css+>
- Aswell as the modules from <https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses>

# Template

- Template used in this project is the one from codeinstitute (link here) <https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template>

# Technology
- This project was written in HTML & CSS using Codeanywhere and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.

## Javascript 

- I created a simple JavaScript video, while not needed for the project it looks good, and since i wanted a video it was needed. I got help from the following website to make it happen - <https://img.ly/blog/how-to-build-video-player-in-javascript/>

## Form element
- When i created the form with the confirmation page i took inspiration from the love running project, but put my own motivational twist on it. I wrote similar code but made some tweaks and changes to make it my own.

# The 5 elements of UX design and how i worked with it to create my website

- Im very into fitness and motivational content, its something i indulge in everyday and my social media algorithms are filled with it. When i made the strategy for the website it was important for me to think what i as a user would appreciate seeing in a motivational website.
Wich led me to thinking that the content should be modern, easy to access, minimalistic and appealing. For a user of this content, the simplicitiy plays a big part, the quotes should lead you on and make you want more content. The father paving the way for his son symbolizes the will to improve for coming generations, wich then leads you as a user to a feeling of fullfillment. That hopefully makes you sign up for more inspirational content through Healthy Habits. I wanted bright colors and a clean look, wich would bare the same feeling as a gym. Hopefully thats the message i got through. 

- The structure of the site felt like one of the more important parts from a user point of view. As i wrote above, the appeal of the website is important when captivating someone through motivational content. Thats why i though a well structured but simple website with punching content would fit for a user. The structure is simple, easy to follow and does not over complicate anything. Wich also felt important in making the content interesting. 

- When creating the wireframe (skeleton) i had a clear picture in mind wich i also had planned out with my mentor, wich made it easy for me to take the first steps in creating a well design and thought through skeleton. The website is minimalistic, wich is the preference used, and the skeleton followed the line of the love running project, but on a simpler scale without as much content and ofcourse in my own way. Header - Main content - Footer made the skeleton, after that bright and uplifting colors where used to style it, wich also shined through in the content when that was added. Creating a sophisticated wireframe before the project started was essential for its developement going smooth. 

- The content and surface plane feels explained in the above text. The minimalistic feeling and captivating content was the important part, not making it to hard for me as a beginner developer but still creating content that would make sense for a user and be soothing to indulge in. Thought through with the quotes from famous athletes to spark a feeling inside the user, to then using the father and his son on the hockeu rink to create a sense of fullfillment, to then making it make sense for the user to sign up and get more inspirational content. The trick is to not give much, but still give enough for it to be interesting. That was something i learned while studying my bachelours degree in business. 

## Bug fixing 

- While bug fixing i ran my code through w3c occasionally during the process to se if i wrote anything wrong, i made it common practice to change and update the code throughout the process. I had a private file where i tried and tested code out before putting into my public codeanywhere IDE to see how it would respond. If it worked well and the changes where good, i cleaned the code of this public file up and copied the code to save myself time and energy, while making the public file run well. 

- I have also linked websites wich helped me fixing bugs and errors where i couldnt understand what was wrong, such as in the CSS, wich gave me the most headache. I indulged in alot of content wich helped alot in understanding how the css could make my content fit in the website, it would have been near impossible without it.
